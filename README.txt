Use your Admail.net List Builder forms in Wordpress! Direct integration into your List Builder mailing list with a simple shortcode.

== Description ==
List Builder by Admail allows you to easily add the perfect sign up form to your WordPress site. The form captures the list member's information and sends it to the database automatically. You can add signup forms to blog posts, site pages, the sidebar, or multiple landing pages. You can also set it to open automatically as a popup modal when customers land on a page. Just grab the Shortcode from your Admail.net account, insert it into the plugin admin settings, and you're ready to go.

List Builder forms are good looking, user-friendly, and mobile optimized. You have complete control over the form fields and can send anything you like to Admail.net.

== Installation ==

1) Go to the Plugins section of the Wordpress admin section (URL: %site root%/wp-admin/plugins.php) and click "Add New" found near the top.
2) From the add plugin page (URL: %site root%/wp-admin/plugin-install.php), search for Admail plugin.
3) Click the "Install" button and wait until its finished.  The button's name should change to "Activate" when finished.
4) Reload the page if needed and push the "Activate" button.
5) Go to a page or post and insert the shortcode (making sure to provide the correct numbers found in the Admail page).
* For embedding the form: [admail account_id=# form_id=#] For showing a modal/colorbox with the form: [admail_modal account_id=# form_id=# start_open=0 link_text='Click Here']
* To set the site wide settings and to configure minified versions please goto the WordPress Settings section and look for the Admail section to enable it.
6) Additional optional shortcode attributes are:
* id. The default id on the link used to open the modal.  Must be unique on the page.
* account_id and form_id is found on the Admail.net website and should be associated with the form.
* start_open, expire_open is valid on the admail_modal. These enable the modal to open in the lighthouse on page load.  The expire_open adds logic that will prevent the modal from opening after the first visit from the user.
